  Its done, there is nothing much to update at least for the moment
}

After login a user redirected to dashboard => {

     
      must be a route apt.get(./getDashboardData, validateRequest, validateUserToken, responseData ) =>{
      
        At first we validate the request itself, of what we are receiving from the client, like if the token 
        is the string etc then call next(). Then we validate and find UserByToken and call next(), after these 2
        succesful checks, we send the data itself which is {
            
            In this case we need to build a somewhat relational usermodel, where a user has
             its own units, or doesnt have any if registered just a while ago
        
        }
        
         
             
      }
}
