                1) Set booking times{
                    need to make it more dynamic with a better table
                    drowdown inside of table to set pricing
                }
                3) Create article{

THIGS THAT HAVENT BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET BUT NEEDS TO BE
    CHAT
        Need to create a chat component that can be used throughout the entire webapp
        can setup a simple firebase account and use that as the db for socket.io connection


            AT the later stage
            3) Payment system when booked (modals) (at the later stage)
            4) Chat (socket IO, example) (at the later stage)
    
    //Payment methods
    //will need to check if stripe provides their own UI for payment or we can use our own.
    1) Setup the top-up credit modal
    2) widhdraw modal

    
    THINGS TO THINK
    1) Need to think of a mobile chat app so that our users can communicate without a laptop
        Its pretty important
