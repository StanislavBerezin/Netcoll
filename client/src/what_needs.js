THIGS THAT HAVENT BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET BUT NEEDS TO BE
    CHAT
        Need to create a chat component that can be used throughout the entire webapp
        can setup a simple firebase account and use that as the db for socket.io connection

    
    //Payment methods
    //will need to check if stripe provides their own UI for payment or we can use our own.
    1) Setup the top-up credit modal
    2) widhdraw modal

    
    THINGS TO THINK
    1) Need to think of a mobile chat app so that our users can communicate without a laptop
        Its pretty important
