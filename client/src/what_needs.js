    5) Section SIMPLER AND QUICKER SUPPORT THAT IS NEEDED
        Dont worry about it at the moment, as its planned out to put vector images after


    5) Make "how it works" section tabs smaller rather than 100% width, maybe add some cool icons
       
    6) Responses that we recieve from server when something is wrong should be displayed as "toast with error"

    7) Add a 404 page

    8) Registration form data validation:
        a) Don't validate username field until the user has entered something (currently validates on load)
        b) Implement password mismatch validation
        c) Keep a list of university options, validate input based on known list of universities. Don't let the enter an unknown uni.
        d) Don't make the registration form disapppear when you click away from it; only when you click the x to close it

    CONTENT CREATORS{

            If you are the content creator{
                1) Set booking times{
                    need to make it more dynamic with a better table
                    drowdown inside of table to set pricing
                }
                3) Create article{
                    4) If user hasn't bought the article only certain parts should be shown, a content creator choses which ones
                }
            }

            If you are VIEWING content creator profile{
                

                }
                

                In the future will add chat etc, but for the moment is not that crucial
            }

            AT the later stage
            3) Payment system when booked (modals) (at the later stage)
            4) Chat (socket IO, example) (at the later stage)
    }


THIGS THAT HAVENT BEEN IMPLEMENTED YET BUT NEEDS TO BE
    CHAT
        Need to create a chat component that can be used throughout the entire webapp
        can setup a simple firebase account and use that as the db for socket.io connection

    
    //Payment methods
    //will need to check if stripe provides their own UI for payment or we can use our own.
    1) Setup the top-up credit modal
    2) widhdraw modal

    
    THINGS TO THINK
    1) Need to think of a mobile chat app so that our users can communicate without a laptop
        Its pretty important
