    3) Functionality to compare passwords on UI
    4) Footer
    5) Make "how it works" section tabs smaller rather than 100% width, maybe add some cool icons
    6) Responses that we recieve from server when something is wrong should be displayed as "toast with error" 
        recieved from server, the same for success (not really needed but would be cool)
